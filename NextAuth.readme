Authentication and authorization with NextAuth using server-side session, or local, strategy

1. Login with NextAuth's Built-in Endpoint
To log in users, you can use the signIn method provided by NextAuth's React API.
It allows you to post user credentials directly to NextAuth's built-in /api/auth/signin endpoint.


2. Logout with NextAuth's Built-in Endpoint
To log users out, you can use the signOut method, which logs the user out by clearing the session
stored in MongoDB.
See components/auth/LogoutButton.jsx


3. Protecting Pages (Optional)
You can protect routes/pages by checking the session state inside your components.


4. Using Built-in Endpoints
NextAuth provides the following built-in API endpoints that you can use for authentication flows:

    /api/auth/signin: The endpoint for logging in users.
    /api/auth/signout: The endpoint for logging out users.
    /api/auth/session: Provides session information for the currently authenticated user.

With these built-in methods, you donâ€™t need to create custom API routes for login/logout.
Just use the signIn and signOut functions in your client-side components.
